Architecture
============

This section describes the comprehensive architecture of the POEditor Plugin application, including core components, data flow, and system integration.

Architecture Components
-----------------------

The application is built using a modular, service-oriented architecture with the following key components:

**Plugin System**
  Core plugin management infrastructure with activity coordination
  → See :doc:`plugin_system` and :doc:`../core/plugin_manager`

**Services Layer**
  Business logic and data operation services
  → See :doc:`services` and :doc:`../services/index`

**Data Models**
  Application data structures and configuration management
  → See :doc:`../models/index`

**Widget System**
  UI components and user interface elements
  → See :doc:`../widgets/index`

**Storage Layer**
  Persistent storage and external system integration
  → See :doc:`../services/file_operations_service`

Architecture Documentation
---------------------------

* **Plugin System Architecture** - Detailed view of the plugin management system,
  activity coordination, and component relationships → :doc:`plugin_system`

* **Services Architecture** - Service layer design showing file operations,
  theme management, and core business services → :doc:`services`

* **Theme System** - Theming architecture with CSS management and
  light/dark mode support → :doc:`theme_system`

Design Principles
-----------------

The architecture follows these key design principles:

**Modularity**
  Components are designed as independent modules with well-defined interfaces
  → See :doc:`../core/index` and :doc:`../services/index`

**Extensibility**
  Plugin system allows for easy addition of new functionality
  → See :doc:`plugin_system` and :doc:`../guides/plugin_development_guide`

**Separation of Concerns**
  Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data layers
  → See :doc:`../widgets/index`, :doc:`../services/index`, and
  :doc:`../models/index`

**Service Orientation**
  Core functionality is provided through reusable services
  → See :doc:`services` and :doc:`../services/index`

**Event-Driven Communication**
  Components communicate through events and signals for loose coupling
  → See :doc:`activity_system` and :doc:`../core/plugin_manager`

**Testability**
  Architecture supports unit testing and integration testing
  → See :doc:`../testing/index`

This design ensures maintainability, scalability, and ease of development while
providing a robust foundation for the POEditor Plugin application.
