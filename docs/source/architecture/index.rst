Architecture Components
-----------------------

The application is built using a modular, service-oriented architecture with the following key components:

**Plugin System**
  Core plugin management infrastructure with activity coordination

**Services Layer**  
  Business logic and data operation services

**Data Models**
  Application data structures and configuration management

**Widget System**
  UI components and user interface elements

**Storage Layer**
  Persistent storage and external system integration

Design Principles
-----------------

The architecture follows these key design principles:

**Modularity**
  Components are designed as independent modules with well-defined interfaces

**Extensibility**
  Plugin system allows for easy addition of new functionality

**Separation of Concerns**
  Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data layers

**Service Orientation**
  Core functionality is provided through reusable services

**Event-Driven Communication**
  Components communicate through events and signals for loose coupling

**Testability**
  Architecture supports unit testing and integration testing

This design ensures maintainability, scalability, and ease of development while providing a robust foundation for the POEditor Plugin application.
