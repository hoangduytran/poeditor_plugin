Preferences System Documentation
=======================================

The Preferences System provides a comprehensive foundation for managing
application settings and user preferences.

This section covers the Phase 1 implementation which establishes the core
infrastructure that all preference panels will build upon.

Overview
========

The preferences system is designed with a modular architecture:

* **Common Components** (Phase 1) - Core infrastructure in
  ``preferences/common/``
* **Text Replacements** (Phase 2) - Find/replace rule management
* **Translation History** (Phase 3) - Translation tracking and history
* **Plugin API** (Phase 4) - Plugin system integration

Current Status
==============

**Phase 1: Complete** âœ…
   Core infrastructure implemented with database layer, UI components,
   search integration, and import/export services.

**Phase 2-4: Planned** ðŸ“‹
   Placeholder directories created with architectural foundation ready for
   implementation.

  examples
* :doc:`preferences_quick_reference` - Quick reference for common tasks

Architecture
============

The preferences system follows these key principles:

1. **Modular Design** - Each phase has its own directory with shared common
   components
2. **Database Integration** - SQLite persistence with migration support
3. **UI Consistency** - Reusable components with theme integration
4. **Search & Filter** - Advanced search capabilities across all preference
   data
5. **Import/Export** - Multiple format support (JSON, CSV, PLIST, YAML)

Getting Started
===============

For developers working with the preferences system:

1. Review the :doc:`preferences_api_documentation` for detailed API information
2. Check the :doc:`preferences_quick_reference` for common usage patterns
3. Examine the test files in ``tests/preferences/`` for working examples
4. See ``preferences/common/`` for the foundation components

Next Steps
==========

With Phase 1 complete, the system is ready for:

* **Phase 2 Implementation** - Text replacements panel using the common
  infrastructure
* **Phase 3 Implementation** - Translation history with database integration
* **Phase 4 Implementation** - Plugin API and extensibility framework
