# POEditor Integration Master Plan

**Date**: July 24, 2025  
**Component**: POEditor Plugin Integration  
**Status**: Planning

## 1. Overview

This master plan outlines the comprehensive strategy for integrating the POEditor functionality from the old application into the new plugin-based architecture. The plan covers all aspects of development from core editor functionality to service integration, settings panels, and UI components.

The integration approach follows a modular design philosophy where each component is developed independently yet works cohesively within the plugin architecture established in the core design. This ensures a clean separation of concerns while maintaining the rich feature set of the original POEditor application.

## 2. Integration Strategy

The POEditor integration will follow a **plugin-first** approach where the functionality is encapsulated within a dedicated plugin rather than being embedded directly in the core application. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Modularity**: POEditor functionality can be updated independently
2. **Clean Architecture**: Core application remains focused on plugin management
3. **Extensibility**: Other plugins can extend the POEditor functionality
4. **Consistency**: Follows the established plugin architecture pattern

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1 POEditor Plugin
A dedicated plugin that provides the core POEditor functionality:
- **Tab Management**: Creates and manages POEditorTab instances
- **File Operations**: Open, save, and export PO files
- **Command Registration**: Register POEditor-specific commands
- **Service Integration**: Connect to core services like search and database

### 3.2 POEditor Tab Component
A tab widget that implements the PO editing interface:
- **Table View**: Display and editing of PO entries
- **Translation Editor**: Rich text editing of translations
- **Navigation Controls**: Paging and entry navigation

## 6. Data Flow

1. **File Opening Flow**:
   - User selects PO file → POEditor plugin creates new tab → POEditorTab loads file → Table model populated → UI updated

2. **Editing Flow**:
   - User selects entry → Translation editor populated → User edits translation → Model updated → File marked as modified

3. **Settings Flow**:
   - User changes setting → Setting stored in QSettings → Applied to POEditorTab instances → Visual feedback provided

4. **Database Integration Flow**:
   - POEditor loads entry → Database queried for history → Suggestions displayed → User selects suggestion → Translation applied

## 7. Integration with Existing Components

### 7.1 Sidebar Manager
- POEditor plugin can register sidebar panels (history browser, etc.)
- Explorer plugin integration for opening PO files

### 7.2 Tab Manager
- POEditor registers tab type for PO files
- Tab lifecycle managed by tab manager

### 7.3 Plugin API
- POEditor uses API for command registration
- Event system used for cross-plugin communication

### 7.4 Settings System
