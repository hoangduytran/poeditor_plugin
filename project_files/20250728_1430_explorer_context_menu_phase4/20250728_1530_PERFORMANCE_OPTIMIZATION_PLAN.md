# Phase 4: Performance Optimization Implementation

**Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Component**: Explorer Context Menu and File Operations  
**Status**: Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for performance optimizations in the Explorer Context Menu and related file operations as part of Phase 4. The main goal is to ensure the application remains responsive and efficient even when dealing with large file sets or complex operations.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Menu Rendering Optimization

#### Tasks:
- Implement lazy loading for context menu items
- Optimize icon loading with caching
- Reduce menu creation overhead

#### Files to Modify:
- `widgets/explorer_context_menu.py`: Optimize menu creation
- `services/icon_manager.py`: Implement icon caching

### 2. File Operations Optimization

#### Tasks:
- Implement batch processing for file operations
- Add progress reporting for long operations
- Optimize clipboard handling for large file sets

#### Files to Modify:
- `services/file_operations_service.py`: Add batch processing
- `services/file_operations_service.py`: Add progress reporting

### 3. Memory Usage Optimization

#### Tasks:
- Reduce memory footprint during file operations
- Implement streaming for large file transfers
- Optimize data structures for file metadata

#### Files to Modify:
- `services/file_operations_service.py`: Optimize memory usage
- `models/file_system_models.py`: Optimize data structures

### 4. Performance Profiling and Monitoring

#### Tasks:
- Add performance metrics collection
- Implement performance monitoring for critical operations
- Create performance test suite

#### Files to Modify:
- `services/performance_monitor.py` (new): Create performance monitoring
- `tests/performance/test_file_operations.py` (new): Add performance tests

## Implementation Steps

1. **Menu Rendering Optimization**
   - Profile menu creation to identify bottlenecks
   - Implement icon caching to reduce load time
   - Add lazy menu item creation for context-specific items

2. **File Operations Optimization**
   - Implement batch processing for multiple file operations
   - Add progress reporting for operations on large files
   - Optimize clipboard handling for large file sets

3. **Memory Usage Optimization**
   - Refactor file operation methods to use generators
   - Implement chunked processing for large file operations
   - Optimize data structures for file metadata

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Create performance monitoring service
   - Add performance metrics collection
   - Create automated performance tests

## Timeline

1. Menu Rendering Optimization: July 29, 2025
2. File Operations Optimization: July 30, 2025
3. Memory Usage Optimization: July 31, 2025
4. Performance Monitoring: August 1, 2025

## Success Criteria

- Context menu appears in under 100ms even with large selections
- File operations show progress for operations taking more than 500ms
- Memory usage remains stable even when operating on large file sets
- All common operations perform within defined performance targets
