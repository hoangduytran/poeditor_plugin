**Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Component**: Explorer Context Menu  
**Status**: Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document serves as the master implementation plan for Phase 4 of the Explorer Context Menu feature. Phase 4 focuses on integration and polish to deliver a highly polished, accessible, and performant context menu experience for users. This plan coordinates the four main components of Phase 4:

1. Keyboard Shortcuts Integration
2. Theming Support
3. Accessibility Improvements
4. Performance Optimization

## Implementation Schedule

#### Monday (July 28)
- Create implementation plans
- Set up testing environment
- Keyboard shortcuts service implementation

#### Tuesday (July 29)
- Keyboard shortcuts visualization
- Context menu theming integration
- Screen reader support basics

#### Wednesday (July 30)
- Keyboard navigation enhancements
- Theme-specific context menu styling
- Performance profiling and initial optimizations

#### Thursday (July 31)
- High contrast theme support
- Memory usage optimization
- Keyboard shortcut configuration UI

#### Friday (August 1)
- Cross-component integration testing
- Accessibility validation
- Performance measurement and tuning

## Cross-Component Dependencies

| Component | Depends On | Required For |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Keyboard Shortcuts | Keyboard Shortcut Service | Accessibility |
| Theming Support | CSS-based Theme Manager | Accessibility |
| Accessibility | Keyboard Shortcuts, Theming | Final User Experience |
| Performance | All Other Components | Final User Experience |

## Testing Approach

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for cross-component functionality
- Performance benchmarks for critical operations

### Manual Testing
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Visual inspection across themes
- Performance testing with large file sets

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Performance regression | Medium | High | Implement performance monitoring, set baselines |
| Accessibility gaps | Medium | Medium | Test with actual assistive technology users |
| Theme inconsistency | Low | Medium | Implement theme preview and comparison tool |
| Shortcut conflicts | Medium | Low | Add shortcut conflict detection and resolution |

## Success Criteria

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: All context menu operations accessible via keyboard
- **Theming**: Context menu appearance consistent in all themes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance for all context menu interactions
- **Performance**: Context menu appears in under 100ms even with large selections

## Documentation Updates Required

- User Guide: Document keyboard shortcuts
- Developer Guide: Document theme integration
- Accessibility Guide: Document accessibility features
- Performance Guide: Document performance considerations

## Conclusion

This master implementation plan coordinates the four main components of Phase 4, ensuring they work together to deliver a polished, accessible, and performant context menu experience. The plan accounts for dependencies between components and establishes clear success criteria for each area of focus.
