# Phase 2 Implementation Plan: Basic Operations

**Date**: July 28, 2025, 07:31  
**Component**: Explorer Context Menu - Phase 2  
**Status**: Implementation Plan  
**Priority**: High

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 2 of the Explorer Context Menu feature, focusing on basic file operations and UI integration. Phase 2 builds upon the core services implemented in Phase 1 and focuses on creating the user interface components and integrating them with the Explorer panel.

## Goals

1. Implement basic file operations UI in the context menu
2. Create the context menu structure and action handlers
3. Integrate the menu with the explorer panel
4. Handle selection states and multi-selection operations

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a **component-based approach**, building each UI element and integrating it with the core services developed in Phase 1. We'll use Qt's signal-slot mechanism extensively to ensure loose coupling between components.

## Components to Implement

### 1. Context Menu UI (3 days)

#### Features:
- Dynamic menu generation based on file types and selection
- Standard menu structure with sections for operations
- Icon support for visual recognition
- Keyboard shortcut display
- Disabled state handling for invalid operations

#### Technical Details:
- Use `QMenu` and `QAction` classes for menu construction
- Integrate with the application's theme system
- Implement event handlers for each menu action
- Support for standard Qt keyboard shortcuts

#### Dependencies:
- PySide6 `QMenu` and `QAction` classes
- Application theme system
- Core services from Phase 1

### 2. File Operations UI Integration (4 days)

#### Features:
- Connect menu actions to `FileOperationsService`
- Implement progress feedback for long-running operations
- Error handling and user notifications
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

#### Technical Details:
- Create operation factories for each menu action
- Build operation pipelines for multi-step operations
- Implement error recovery strategies
- Design confirmation dialog templates

#### Dependencies:
- `FileOperationsService` from Phase 1
- `UndoRedoManager` from Phase 1
- Application notification system

### 3. Explorer Panel Integration (3 days)

#### Features:
- Context menu attachment to Explorer tree view
- Selection state tracking
- Item type detection for context-sensitive menus
- Multi-selection support

#### Technical Details:
- Hook into Explorer panel's tree view events
- Create selection state manager
- Implement file type detection system
- Design special handling for multi-selection scenarios

#### Dependencies:
- Explorer panel implementation
- File system model

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test menu generation with various file types
   - Test action handlers with mock services
   - Test selection state tracking

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test full operation pipelines
   - Test undo/redo integration
   - Test with various selection scenarios

3. **UI Tests**:
   - Test menu appearance and behavior
   - Test keyboard shortcuts
   - Test with different themes

## Timeline

| Task | Duration | Target Completion |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Context Menu UI | 3 days | July 31, 2025 |
| File Operations UI Integration | 4 days | August 4, 2025 |
| Explorer Panel Integration | 3 days | August 7, 2025 |
| Testing and Bug Fixes | 2 days | August 9, 2025 |

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Integration complexity with Explorer panel | Medium | Start with simplified integration and refine |
| Performance issues with large selections | High | Implement batch processing and progress feedback |
| User experience inconsistencies | Medium | Conduct early usability testing |
| Platform-specific behavior | Low | Test on all target platforms early |

## Success Criteria

1. All basic file operations are accessible through the context menu
2. Operations work correctly with both single and multiple selections
3. Context menu appears in the correct position and with appropriate items
4. Undo/redo functionality works for all operations
5. User receives appropriate feedback for all operations
6. Performance is acceptable even with large directories
