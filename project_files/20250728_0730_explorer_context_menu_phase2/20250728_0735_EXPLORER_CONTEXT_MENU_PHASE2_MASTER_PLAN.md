# Explorer Context Menu Phase 2 Master Plan

**Date**: July 28, 2025, 07:35  
**Component**: Explorer Context Menu - Phase 2 Overview  
**Status**: Technical Overview  
**Priority**: High

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Phase 2 of the Explorer Context Menu implementation. Phase 2 builds on the foundation laid in Phase 1 (core services) and focuses on creating the UI components and integrating them with the Explorer panel.

## Phase 2 Components

Phase 2 consists of the following key components:

1. **Context Menu UI**
   - Menu structure and organization
   - Visual design and interaction patterns
   - Conditional menu items based on selection

2. **File Operations UI Integration**
   - Connection between menu actions and file operations service
   - Progress indication for long-running operations
   - Error handling and user feedback
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

3. **Explorer Panel Integration**
   - Context menu attachment to Explorer tree view
   - Selection state tracking and management
   - Item type detection for context-sensitive menus
   - Coordination with other Explorer features (double-click, drag-drop)

## Document Structure

The Phase 2 implementation is documented in the following files:

1. **[20250728_0731_PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](20250728_0731_PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)**
   - Overall implementation approach
   - Component breakdown
   - Timeline and milestones
   - Testing strategy

2. **[20250728_0732_CONTEXT_MENU_UI_DESIGN.md](20250728_0732_CONTEXT_MENU_UI_DESIGN.md)**
   - Menu structure and organization
   - Visual design specifications
   - Interaction patterns
   - Conditional logic for menu items

3. **[20250728_0733_FILE_OPERATIONS_UI_INTEGRATION.md](20250728_0733_FILE_OPERATIONS_UI_INTEGRATION.md)**
   - Action handlers for menu items
   - Progress indication for operations
   - Error handling and recovery
   - User feedback mechanisms

4. **[20250728_0734_EXPLORER_PANEL_INTEGRATION.md](20250728_0734_EXPLORER_PANEL_INTEGRATION.md)**
   - Tree view context menu integration
   - Selection tracking and management
   - File type detection
   - Coordination with other Explorer features

## Dependencies

Phase 2 builds on the following components from Phase 1:

1. **FileOperationsService**: Provides core file operations functionality
2. **UndoRedoManager**: Provides undo/redo tracking for operations
3. **FileNumberingService**: Handles automatic file numbering for duplicates

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a **layered approach**:

1. **Layer 1: Core UI Components**
   - Basic context menu structure
   - Menu generation logic
   - Action creation

2. **Layer 2: Integration Layer**
   - Connection to file operations service
   - Integration with Explorer panel
   - Selection state management

3. **Layer 3: User Experience**
   - Progress indication
   - Error handling
   - User feedback
   - Confirmation dialogs

## Testing Strategy

Testing will cover all aspects of the implementation:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test each component in isolation
   - Test with mock dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Test with real file system operations

3. **UI Tests**
   - Test menu appearance and behavior
   - Test with different selection scenarios

## Timeline

| Milestone | Description | Target Date |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Core UI Components | Basic context menu structure and generation | July 31, 2025 |
| Integration Layer | Connection to services and Explorer panel | August 4, 2025 |
| User Experience | Progress, errors, feedback, and dialogs | August 7, 2025 |
| Testing & Refinement | Testing and bug fixes | August 9, 2025 |

## Next Steps

After Phase 2 is complete, we will move on to Phase 3: Drag & Drop Integration, which will enhance the Explorer with drag and drop functionality that integrates with the file operations implemented in Phases 1 and 2.
