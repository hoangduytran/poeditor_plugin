# Explorer Context Menu Implementation

This directory contains the implementation for Phase 2 of the Explorer Context Menu feature, as specified in the design documents at `project_files/20250728_0730_explorer_context_menu_phase2/`.

## Components Implemented

1. **ExplorerContextMenu** (`widgets/explorer_context_menu.py`):
   - Context menu manager for file operations
   - Adapts menu items based on selection (files, folders, or mixed)
   - Connects to file operations services

2. **EnhancedFileView** (`widgets/enhanced_file_view.py`):
   - Extended SimpleFileView with context menu support
   - Proper selection handling for right-click operations

3. **EnhancedExplorerWidget** (`widgets/enhanced_explorer_widget.py`):
   - Extended SimpleExplorerWidget with context menu functionality
   - Integrates with file operations services

4. **EnhancedExplorerPanel** (`panels/enhanced_explorer_panel.py`):
   - Panel implementation using the enhanced explorer widget
   - Ready to be integrated into the main application

## Integration Guide

To integrate the enhanced explorer panel with context menu support into the main application:

1. Open `core/main_app_window.py`

2. Modify the `setup_sidebar_buttons` method to use the enhanced explorer panel:

   ```python
   # Change this:
   from panels.explorer_panel import ExplorerPanel
   explorer_panel = ExplorerPanel()
   
   # To this:
   from panels.enhanced_explorer_panel import EnhancedExplorerPanel
   explorer_panel = EnhancedExplorerPanel()
   ```

3. Restart the application to see the new context menu functionality.

## Features Implemented

- Context menu appears on right-click in the explorer
- Menu adapts to selection (files, folders, or empty space)
- Support for operations:
  - Copy, Cut, Paste
  - Delete (with confirmation)
  - Rename
  - Duplicate
  - New File/Folder
  - Open in Terminal
  - Properties
  
## Known Limitations

- Some advanced features are not yet implemented:
  - "Open With" functionality requires additional implementation
  - Favorites system is not yet integrated
  - Template system for "New From Template" is not yet implemented
  - Plugin extension points for context menu are not yet implemented

## Next Steps

The next phase (Phase 3) will focus on:
- Drag & Drop integration
- Additional performance optimizations
- Plugin extension points for the context menu
