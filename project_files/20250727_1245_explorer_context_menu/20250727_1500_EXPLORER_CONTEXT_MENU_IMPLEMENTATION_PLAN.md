# Explorer Context Menu Implementation Plan

**Date**: July 27, 2025, 15:00  
**Component**: Explorer Context Menu Implementation Plan  
**Status**: Technical Documentation  
**Priority**: High

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Explorer Context Menu feature, breaking down the development into manageable phases. This plan provides a roadmap for implementing the components described in the technical documentation.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a **bottom-up approach**, starting with core services and gradually building up to the user interface components. This approach ensures that foundational services are thoroughly tested before higher-level components depend on them.

## Phase 1: Core Services Implementation (2 weeks)

### Components:
- **FileNumberingService**
  - Pattern extraction
  - Auto-numbering logic
  - Conflict resolution
  
- **UndoRedoManager**
  - Operation tracking
  - History management
  - Undo/redo stack
  
- **FileOperationsService**
  - Core file operations (copy, cut, paste, delete, rename)
  - Clipboard management
  - Operation error handling

### Deliverables:
1. Fully implemented core services with unit tests
2. Service API documentation
3. Integration test harness for validating service interactions

### Timeline:
- Days 1-3: FileNumberingService implementation and unit tests
- Days 4-8: UndoRedoManager implementation and unit tests
- Days 9-12: FileOperationsService implementation and unit tests
- Days 13-14: Integration testing and bug fixes

## Phase 2: UI Components & Drag-Drop (1.5 weeks)

### Components:
- **DragDropManager**
  - Drag source implementation
  - Drop target handling
  - Operation visualization
  
- **ExplorerContextMenu**
  - Menu structure
  - Action handlers
  - Dynamic menu generation

### Deliverables:
1. Implemented UI components with tests
2. Drag and drop functionality
3. Context menu structure

### Timeline:
- Days 1-5: DragDropManager implementation and tests
- Days 6-9: ExplorerContextMenu implementation and tests
- Days 10-11: Integration and testing

## Phase 3: Integration & Extension Points (1.5 weeks)

### Components:
- **Plugin Extension System**
  - Extension point definition
  - Plugin discovery
  - Menu contribution API
  
- **Template System**
  - Template registration
  - "New From Template" functionality
  - Template management

### Deliverables:
1. Extension point system for plugins
2. Template system implementation
3. Integration with existing components

### Timeline:
- Days 1-5: Extension point system implementation
- Days 6-9: Template system implementation
- Days 10-11: Integration testing

## Phase 4: Polish & Performance (1 week)

### Components:
- **Performance optimization**
  - Large directory handling
  - Operation batching
  - UI responsiveness

- **UI Polish**
  - Icons and visual cues
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Accessibility improvements

### Deliverables:
1. Performance benchmarks and improvements
2. Polished UI with accessibility support
3. Documentation updates

### Timeline:
- Days 1-3: Performance optimization
- Days 4-5: UI polish
- Days 6-7: Final testing and documentation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Each service and component will have comprehensive unit tests
- Mock dependencies to isolate functionality
- Cover edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Validate undo/redo across complex operations
- Test extension points with sample plugins

### UI Testing
- Automated UI tests for context menu operations
- Manual testing for drag and drop behaviors
- Accessibility testing

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks:
1. **File System Permissions**: Different operating systems handle file permissions differently
   - Mitigation: Abstract file system operations and handle platform-specific edge cases

2. **Undo/Redo Complexity**: Complex operations may be difficult to properly undo/redo
   - Mitigation: Start with simple operations, build comprehensive test suite

3. **Performance with Large Directories**: Operations may be slow on directories with many files
   - Mitigation: Implement progressive loading and operation batching

4. **Plugin System Complexity**: Extension points may introduce unexpected behaviors
   - Mitigation: Define clear interfaces and validation for plugin contributions

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the Explorer Context Menu feature. By breaking the work into focused phases with clear deliverables, we can ensure steady progress and early identification of issues. The bottom-up approach ensures that core services are solid before building dependent components.

Following this plan will result in a robust, extensible context menu system that provides a seamless experience for users while maintaining performance and reliability.
