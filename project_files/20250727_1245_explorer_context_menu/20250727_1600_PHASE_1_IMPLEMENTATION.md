# Phase 1 Implementation: Core Services

**Date**: July 27, 2025, 16:00  
**Component**: Explorer Context Menu - Phase 1 Implementation  
**Status**: Implementation Complete  
**Priority**: High

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 1 of the Explorer Context Menu feature, focusing on the core services that provide the foundation for file operations, undo/redo functionality, and file numbering.

## Implemented Components

### 1. FileNumberingService

The FileNumberingService provides functionality to generate unique file and folder names when duplicates are created. It can detect and extract numbering patterns from existing files and generate the next number in sequence.

**Key Features:**
- Pattern detection for various naming conventions (parentheses, underscore, dash)
- Automatic increment of existing numbered files
- Conflict resolution with numbered alternatives
- Support for different naming pattern preferences

**Location:** `/services/file_numbering_service.py`

### 2. UndoRedoManager

The UndoRedoManager provides a centralized system for tracking operations that can be undone and redone. It maintains separate stacks for undo and redo operations.

**Key Features:**
- Recording of operations with complete metadata
- Stack-based undo/redo system
- Support for operation peeking without popping
- Configurable history size limit

**Location:** `/services/undo_redo_service.py`

### 3. FileOperationsService

The FileOperationsService provides a comprehensive set of file operations with proper error handling, undo/redo support, and event notifications via signals.

**Key Features:**
- Core file operations: copy, cut, paste, move, delete, rename, duplicate
- Clipboard management with system clipboard integration
- File creation operations (new file, new folder)
- Complete undo/redo support for all operations
- Signal-based event notification system
- Error handling and reporting

**Location:** `/services/file_operations_service.py`

### 4. Supporting Models

The implementation also includes the FileSystemItem data class to represent file system items in a structured way, which will be useful for the Explorer UI in later phases.

**Location:** `/models/file_system_models.py`

## Tests

Comprehensive unit tests and integration tests have been created to ensure the services work correctly:

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - `test_file_numbering_service.py`: Tests for pattern extraction, name generation, etc.
   - `test_undo_redo_service.py`: Tests for operation recording, undo/redo functionality, etc.
   - `test_file_operations_service.py`: Tests for each file operation, signal emissions, etc.

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - `test_core_services_integration.py`: Tests to verify that all services work together correctly in complex scenarios

## Implementation Details

### Consistent API Design

All services follow a consistent API design with:
- Clear method signatures with type hints
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Proper error handling and reporting

### Signal-based Communication

The FileOperationsService uses Qt's signal/slot system for event notifications:
- `operationStarted`: Emitted when an operation begins
- `operationCompleted`: Emitted when an operation completes successfully
- `operationFailed`: Emitted when an operation fails
- `clipboardChanged`: Emitted when the internal clipboard state changes

### Platform Compatibility

The services are designed to work across different platforms:
- Path handling using os.path for cross-platform compatibility
- Platform-specific optimizations where appropriate
- Graceful fallback for unsupported features

## Usage Examples

### Basic File Operations

```python
# Create service instance
file_ops = FileOperationsService()

# Copy files
file_ops.copy_to_clipboard(["/path/to/file.txt", "/path/to/folder"])

# Paste to target
new_paths = file_ops.paste("/path/to/destination")

# Create new file
new_file = file_ops.create_new_file("/path/to/folder", "script.py")

# Delete files
file_ops.delete_items(["/path/to/temp.txt"])

# Undo last operation
file_ops.undo()
```

### Clipboard Integration

```python
# Get clipboard contents
mode, paths = file_ops.get_clipboard_contents()

if mode == "copy" and file_ops.can_paste(target_dir):
    file_ops.paste(target_dir)
```

### Undo/Redo Support

```python
# Check if operations can be undone/redone
if file_ops.can_undo():
    file_ops.undo()
    
if file_ops.can_redo():
    file_ops.redo()
```

## Next Steps

With the core services implemented, we can now proceed to Phase 2 (UI Components & Drag-Drop):

1. Implement DragDropManager for drag and drop functionality
2. Implement ExplorerContextMenu for the actual context menu UI
3. Connect these components to the core services implemented in Phase 1

## Conclusion

The Phase 1 implementation provides a solid foundation for the Explorer Context Menu feature. The core services are thoroughly tested and ready to be used by the UI components that will be implemented in Phase 2.
