# Column Header Context Menu Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of column header context menu functionality in the Explorer panel. The implementation builds upon the existing navigation functionality while adding column management capabilities as specified in the design document.

## Implementation Components

### 1. ColumnManagerService

The `ColumnManagerService` class manages column visibility and properties for the explorer view. It provides methods to toggle column visibility, manage column widths, and control content fitting behavior.

**Key Features:**
- Tracks available columns with properties (name, size, type, modified date)
- Maintains column visibility state
- Controls column content fitting behavior
- Persists column settings between application sessions
- Ensures required columns (e.g., "Name") cannot be hidden

**Key Methods:**
- `get_visible_columns()`: Returns the list of currently visible column IDs
- `set_column_visibility(column_id, visible)`: Shows or hides a column
- `get_fit_content_enabled()`: Checks if fit content to values is enabled
- `set_fit_content_enabled(enabled)`: Sets the fit content setting
- `reset_column_widths()`: Resets all column widths to their defaults

### 2. HeaderNavigationWidget Enhancements

The `HeaderNavigationWidget` class has been enhanced to integrate column management into the existing header context menu:

**Key Enhancements:**
- Added column management section to the header context menu
- Implemented column visibility toggle functionality
- Added fit content toggle option
- Added reset column widths functionality
- Added "Go to Path..." dialog functionality
- Connected to sectionResized signal to track manual column width adjustments

**Key Methods:**
- `_add_column_management_section(menu)`: Adds column management section to the context menu
- `_toggle_column_visibility(column_id, visible)`: Handles column visibility toggling
- `_toggle_fit_content(enabled)`: Toggles fit content mode
- `_reset_column_widths()`: Resets column widths to defaults
- `_show_goto_path_dialog()`: Shows dialog for direct path navigation

### 3. EnhancedFileView Integration

The `EnhancedFileView` class has been updated to work with the column manager:

**Key Changes:**
- Added support for column manager service
- Implemented initial column settings application
- Added handling of column visibility changes from the header

**Key Methods:**
- `_apply_initial_column_settings()`: Applies initial column settings on startup
- `_on_column_visibility_changed(visible_columns)`: Handles column visibility changes

### 4. GotoPathDialog Component

The `GotoPathDialog` class provides a dialog interface for direct path navigation:

**Key Features:**
- Path entry field with autocomplete functionality
- Path history dropdown with recently visited locations
- Path validation with real-time feedback
- Browse button to open file dialog for path selection
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility support

**Key Methods:**
- `show()`: Displays the dialog with focus on path entry field
- `_validate_path(path)`: Validates if entered path exists
- `_on_path_accepted()`: Handles path navigation when user confirms
- `_on_browse_clicked()`: Opens file dialog for path selection
- `_update_history(path)`: Updates path history with new valid paths

### 5. EnhancedExplorerWidget Integration

The `EnhancedExplorerWidget` class has been updated to create and use the column manager service:

**Key Changes:**
- Added column manager service creation
- Added path history management for Go to Path dialog
- Passed column manager to file view for context menu setup

## User Interface

The column header context menu now includes the following sections:

1. **Column Management**
   - Checkbox items for Name, Size, Type, and Modified Date columns
   - Fit Content to Values toggle option
   - Reset Column Widths action

2. **Navigation** (Existing)
   - Current path display
   - Back, Forward, Up navigation actions
   - Go to Path... dialog
   - Quick locations and bookmarks

## Behavior

### Column Visibility

- Column visibility is toggled via checkboxes in the context menu
- Required columns (e.g., "Name") cannot be hidden
- Column visibility changes are immediately applied
- Column visibility state is persisted between application sessions

### Content Fitting

- When enabled, columns automatically resize to fit their content
- When disabled, columns maintain their manual or default widths
- Content fitting setting is persisted between sessions

### Column Width Reset

- Resets all column widths to their default values
- Maintains current column visibility settings

### Go to Path

- Opens a dialog for direct path navigation
- Allows users to manually enter or paste file system paths
- Provides autocomplete suggestions based on available directories
- Maintains a history of recently visited paths
- Validates paths before navigation
- Provides clear feedback for invalid paths
- Supports keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

## Settings Persistence

Settings are persisted using the following keys in the `ExplorerSettings`:

### Column Settings
- `explorer_visible_columns`: List of visible column IDs
- `explorer_fit_column_content`: Boolean indicating if fit content is enabled
- `explorer_column_widths`: Dictionary mapping column IDs to custom widths

### Navigation Settings
- `explorer_path_history`: List of recently visited paths (for Go to Path dialog)
- `explorer_max_path_history`: Maximum number of paths to store in history

## Testing

The implementation includes test cases that verify:

1. Column visibility toggling
2. Content fitting behavior
3. Column width resetting
4. Persistence of settings
5. Go to Path dialog functionality
   - Path validation
   - History management
   - Navigation to entered paths

## Future Enhancements

1. **Column Reordering**: Allow users to reorder columns via drag and drop
2. **Custom Columns**: Support for adding custom columns (e.g., creation date, permissions)
3. **Column Sorting**: Enhanced sorting options with multiple column support
4. **Column Width Persistence**: Remember column widths for specific directories
5. **Advanced Path Navigation**: Enhanced path completion with fuzzy matching and favorites
6. **Path Bookmarking**: Allow users to bookmark paths from the Go to Path dialog

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete solution for column management and advanced navigation via the column header context menu. It integrates seamlessly with the existing navigation functionality while adding powerful column management capabilities and direct path navigation through the Go to Path dialog. These enhancements significantly improve user efficiency and flexibility when navigating and managing the file explorer view.
