**Date**: July 28, 2025, 12:00  
**Component**: Explorer Context Menu - Phase 2 Implementation  
**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: High

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 2 of the Explorer Context Menu feature. Building on the foundation of core services from Phase 1, this phase focuses on implementing the basic file operations UI, context menu structure, and integration with the Explorer panel.

## Goals

1. Create a fully functional context menu system for the Explorer panel
2. Implement UI components for all basic file operations
3. Integrate context menu with existing Explorer panel
4. Ensure consistent behavior and proper selection handling

## Implementation Timeline

| Task | Estimated Duration | Target Completion |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Context Menu UI Structure | 3 days | July 31, 2025 |
| File Operations UI | 4 days | August 4, 2025 |
| Explorer Panel Integration | 3 days | August 7, 2025 |
| Testing and Refinement | 2 days | August 9, 2025 |
