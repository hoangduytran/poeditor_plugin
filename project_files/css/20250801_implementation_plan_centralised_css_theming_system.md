# Centralized CSS Theming System Implementation Plan

## 1. Objectives
- Establish a single source of truth for all application themes (light, dark, colorful, etc.)
- Enable dynamic theme switching at runtime (e.g., via Ctrl+Shift+T)
- Ensure consistent widget styling across the application
- Simplify theme maintenance and future extension

## 2. Phased Implementation

### Phase 1: Centralize and Refactor CSS/QSS
- Audit all existing theme/style files
- Move all runtime QSS/CSS files to `themes/css/`
- Refactor QSS to use variables and shared components where possible
- Remove or archive legacy/duplicated theme files
- Update resource loading to reference only centralized files

### Phase 2: Theme Management API
- Implement a `ThemeManager` class to handle theme loading, switching, and persistence
- Expose theme switching via UI and keyboard shortcut
- Integrate with configuration service for user preferences

### Phase 3: Component Styling and Testing
- Ensure all widgets/components use centralized styles
- Write and run tests for theme switching and widget appearance
- Document theme/component style guidelines

## 3. Architecture Overview
- All runtime QSS/CSS files reside in `themes/css/`
- `ThemeManager` loads and applies QSS at runtime
- Theme switching triggers QSS reload and signals to widgets
- Widgets/components reference only centralized QSS

## 4. Migration Plan
- Identify and list all legacy theme/style files
- Migrate relevant styles to `themes/css/`
- Remove or archive unused/duplicated files
- Update codebase to reference only centralized QSS

## 5. Testing Strategy
- Create test scripts for theme switching and widget styling
- Automate tests to verify correct QSS application
- Manual QA for edge cases and visual consistency

## 6. Documentation
- Maintain this plan as a living document
- Document theme structure, API, and usage for developers
