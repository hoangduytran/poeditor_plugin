# CSS Centralization Phase 4: Testing and Optimization Plan

**Date**: August 4, 2025  
**Branch**: `feature/css-centralization-phase4-testing-optimization`  
**Project**: PySide POEditor Plugin

## 🎯 **Phase 4 Objectives**

Complete the CSS centralization project with comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and documentation to ensure production readiness.

### **Success Criteria from Implementation Plan:**
1. **Consistency**: All components use the same variable system ✅ (Already achieved)
2. **Performance**: Theme switching takes < 100ms ⏳ (To be measured)
3. **Maintainability**: New components can be styled without modifying theme files ✅ (Already achieved)
4. **Extensibility**: New themes can be added without touching component files ✅ (Already achieved)
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and tooling for CSS development ⏳ (To be completed)
