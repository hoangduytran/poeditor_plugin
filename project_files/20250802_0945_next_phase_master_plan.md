# Next Phase Integration Master Plan

**Date**: August 2, 2025  
**Component**: Full Application Integration  
**Status**: Planning - Updated

## 1. Purpose
This master plan defines the next phase of development, integrating legacy PO Editor components with the new plugin-based architecture. It aligns with the design guidelines (`project_files/project/rules.md`) and existing design documents in `project_files/old_po_app_design/`.

## 2. Current Status Assessment
- ✅ Core plugin architecture established
- ✅ Settings system framework implemented
- ✅ Basic UI components designed
- 🔄 Legacy component integration in progress
- ✅ Service layer integration designs complete
- ✅ Advanced features integration designs complete

## 3. Revised Phased Roadmap

### Phase 1: Preferences Panel Consolidation ⭐ PRIORITY
- Audit existing PANEL_DESIGN documents against legacy preferences
- Consolidate tabular preference arrangement into unified design
- Implement QSettings migration for legacy preference storage
- **Status**: ✅ Design Complete - `20250802_1015_preferences_consolidation.md`

### Phase 2: Translation Database Service Integration
- Merge legacy `pref/tran_history` with `services/translation_db_service.py`
- Implement database migration and upgrade paths
- Design plugin-compatible database access layer
- **Status**: ✅ Design Complete - `20250802_1020_translation_database_integration.md`

### Phase 3: Search and Replace System
- Integrate Find/Replace functionality from legacy codebase
- Design plugin-aware search across translation units
- Implement regex and advanced search patterns
- **Status**: ✅ Design Complete - `20250802_1025_search_replace_integration.md`

### Phase 4: Translation Services Integration
- Integrate Google Translation suggestions system
- Design pluggable translation provider architecture
- Implement caching and rate limiting for external services
- **Status**: ✅ Design Complete - `20250802_1030_translation_services_integration.md`

### Phase 5: Advanced UI Features
- Integrate paging system for large PO files
- Implement macOS-specific text replacement panel
- Design responsive UI for different screen sizes
- **Status**: ✅ Design Complete - `20250802_1035_advanced_ui_features.md`

### Phase 6: Quality Assurance and Testing
- Implement comprehensive test suite per `rules.md`
- Design integration tests for legacy component compatibility
- Create performance benchmarks and optimization plans
- **Status**: 🔄 Ready for Design - `20250802_1040_qa_testing_plan.md`
