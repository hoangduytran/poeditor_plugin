Here’s a step-by-step plan to verify and improve the FontSettingsTab’s font/font-size management, based on your current implementation and the goal that changes in this tab should immediately signal components to redraw and update the UI.

## 1. Current State Analysis

From your `FontSettingsTab` code:
- Font changes emit signals (`font_changed`, `font_changed_detailed`, `font_broadcast`).
- The method `update_component_font` updates previews, saves to QSettings, emits signals, and calls `_apply_font_to_components`.
- `_apply_font_to_components` attempts to update all widgets of the relevant type in the running QApplication.
- The `apply_font_settings` method saves settings and calls `on_apply_fonts()` from `main_utils.actions_factory`.

## 2. What Needs to be Verified

- When a user changes a font or size in the tab, the change is:
  - Reflected in the preview label and the relevant UI widgets immediately (live preview).
  - Persisted in QSettings.
  - Emitted via the appropriate signals.
  - Applied to all relevant widgets in the application (not just the preview).

## 3. What Remains to be Done

- Ensure all relevant UI components listen to the signals from `FontSettingsTab` and update their fonts accordingly.
- Confirm that `_apply_font_to_components` covers all widget types that need updating.
- Ensure that the font changes are not only applied to currently visible widgets but also to any new widgets created after the change.
- Add or improve tests (unit or integration) to simulate font changes and verify UI updates.
- Document the signal/slot connections and update mechanism for maintainability.

## 4. Design for Robust Font/Style Management

### a. Centralized Font Management
- `FontSettingsTab` acts as the central manager and broadcaster for font changes.
- All UI components that need to react to font changes should connect to the `font_changed` or `font_broadcast` signals.

### b. Signal/Slot Connections
- On initialization, relevant widgets (or their controllers) should connect to the signals from `FontSettingsTab`.
- When a font is changed, the signal should trigger a slot in the widget/controller to update its font.

### c. Immediate UI Update
- The `update_component_font` method should:
  - Update the preview.
  - Emit the signal.
  - Call a method that updates all relevant widgets (already implemented as `_apply_font_to_components`).

### d. Persistence
- Font settings should be saved to QSettings and reloaded on startup.

### e. Testing
- Unit tests for `FontSettingsTab` to ensure signals are emitted and settings are saved.
- Integration/UI tests to simulate user interaction and verify that widgets update their fonts in real time.

## 5. Next Steps

1. Review all UI components to ensure they listen to font change signals.
2. Add or update tests to simulate font changes and verify UI updates.
3. Optionally, refactor `_apply_font_to_components` for extensibility (e.g., plugin widgets, custom components).
4. Document the font management workflow.

Would you like me to:
- Check for missing signal/slot connections in your codebase?
- Draft a test plan or sample test code for this feature?
- Suggest improvements to the current implementation for better extensibility?

Let me know which step you want to proceed with, or if you want a sample test implementation!
