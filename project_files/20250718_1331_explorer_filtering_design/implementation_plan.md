**Time:** 13:45  
**Component:** Explorer Panel Filtering Implementation  
**Status:** Planning Phase

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the Explorer Filtering System design. The plan prioritizes solving the immediate `*.txt` filtering problem while building a foundation for future text editor integration and statistical analysis.

## Implementation Strategy

### Principle: Progressive Enhancement
1. **Start Small**: Fix the immediate `*.txt` filtering issue
2. **Build Foundation**: Create extensible architecture
3. **Add Features**: Incrementally add capabilities as needed
4. **Maintain Quality**: Test thoroughly at each phase

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (IMMEDIATE - Week 1)
**Goal**: Fix `*.txt` filtering and establish core architecture

- [ ] Include proper error handling for file system operations

#### 1.2 Simple Integration (Days 2-3)
- [ ] Modify `SimpleFileView` to use new filter engine
- [ ] Replace complex `SimpleFilterProxyModel` with simple implementation
- [ ] Ensure `*.txt` filtering works correctly
- [ ] Add basic unit tests for core functionality

#### 1.3 Testing & Validation (Days 3-4)
- [ ] Create test cases in `tests/explorer/test_filter_engine.py`
- [ ] Test all basic filter patterns: `*.txt`, `*.py`, `readme*`, etc.
- [ ] Verify filtering works in different directories
- [ ] Performance testing with large directories (1000+ files)

#### 1.4 Documentation (Day 4)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Performance with Large Directories**
   - **Risk**: Slow filtering on directories with 10,000+ files
   - **Mitigation**: Implement incremental scanning and caching in Phase 3
   - **Fallback**: Provide manual pagination and filtering limits

2. **Memory Usage with Large Result Sets**
   - **Risk**: Memory exhaustion with massive filter results
   - **Mitigation**: Stream results and implement result pagination
   - **Fallback**: Add result size limits with user warnings

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - **Risk**: Breaking existing explorer functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain compatibility layer throughout Phase 1
   - **Fallback**: Feature flags to toggle between old/new systems

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Complex Filter Pattern Edge Cases**
   - **Risk**: Regex or glob patterns causing crashes
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive pattern validation and error handling
   
2. **File System Permission Issues**
   - **Risk**: Filtering fails on restricted directories
   - **Mitigation**: Graceful permission error handling

3. **Cross-Platform File System Differences**
   - **Risk**: Filtering behaves differently on Windows/Mac/Linux
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive cross-platform testing

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Standards
- **Coverage**: Minimum 90% test coverage for core functionality
- **Linting**: flake8 and pylint compliance
- **Type Checking**: mypy validation for all public APIs
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and usage examples

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Small Directories** (< 100 files): < 10ms filter response
- **Medium Directories** (100-1000 files): < 100ms filter response
- **Large Directories** (1000-10,000 files): < 1000ms filter response
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB for 10,000 file results

### User Experience Validation
- **Usability Testing**: Validate filter UI with real users
- **Performance Testing**: Test on real project directories
- **Compatibility Testing**: Verify with existing POEditor workflows

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1 Migration (Immediate)
```python
# Old code using SimpleFilterProxyModel
proxy_model.set_filter_text("*.txt")

# New code using ExplorerFilterEngine (backward compatible)
criteria = FilterCriteria(pattern="*.txt")
result = filter_engine.filter_directory(path, criteria)
```

### Phase 2+ Migration (Gradual)
```python
# Enhanced functionality becomes available
criteria = FilterCriteria(
    pattern="*.py",
    scope=FilterScope.RECURSIVE,
    target=FilterTarget.FILES_ONLY,
    include_hidden=True
)
```

### Legacy Support Timeline
- **Phase 1-2**: Full backward compatibility maintained
- **Phase 3**: Deprecation warnings for old API
- **Phase 4**: Legacy API removal (with migration tools)

## Success Metrics
