# Explorer Header Navigation - Project Summary

**Date**: July 29, 2025, 08:40  
**Component**: Explorer Header Navigation System  
**Status**: Documentation Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Priority**: High

## Project Overview

The Explorer Header Navigation System is a comprehensive enhancement to the existing Explorer panel that adds advanced navigation capabilities through a right-click context menu on the header bar. The system provides quick location access, path search, navigation buttons, and column management functionality.

## Key Features Designed

### 1. Header Context Menu
- **Right-click activation** on Explorer header bar
- **Quick locations** (Home, Root, Applications, Documents, etc.)
- **Recent locations** with timestamps
- **Bookmark management** with custom icons and names
- **Navigation actions** (Go to Path, Manage Bookmarks)
- **Column management** (Add/Remove, Settings, Reset)

### 2. Enhanced Navigation UI
```
[Goto ▼] [Search Field                    ] [← → ↑ 🏠]
┌──────┬─────────────┬─────────────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Name │ Size        │ Modified            │ Type         │
```

### 3. Advanced Column Management
- **Add/Remove columns**: Name, Size, Modified, Type, Created, Permissions, Owner, Extension, Path
- **Column attributes**: Width, resizable, alignment, sort order
- **Column manager dialog** with tabbed interface
- **Persistence** of user preferences

### 4. Smart Navigation Services
- **Navigation history** with back/forward functionality
- **Path auto-completion** with background threading
- **Bookmark system** with import/export
- **Recent locations** with intelligent caching

## Architecture Design
