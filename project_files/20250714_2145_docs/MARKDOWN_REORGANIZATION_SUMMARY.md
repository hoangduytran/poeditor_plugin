# Markdown File Reorganization Summary

## Overview
Reorganized all markdown files in the project according to rules.md rule 13 and best practices for project structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `project_files/` Directory
Created a new directory to house all project-related documentation:
- `project_files/`

### 2. Moved Project-Related Files to `project_files/`
The following files were moved from the root directory to `project_files/`:

**Design and Planning Documents:**
- `rules.md` → `project_files/rules.md`
- `project_design.md` → `project_files/project_design.md`
- `part_one_design.md` → `project_files/part_one_design.md`
- `plan_for_font_change.md` → `project_files/plan_for_font_change.md`
- `plan-verify-font-management-working.md` → `project_files/plan-verify-font-management-working.md`

**Project Reports and Summaries:**
- `FONT_MANAGER_FINAL_REPORT.md` → `project_files/FONT_MANAGER_FINAL_REPORT.md`
- `FONT_SYSTEM_FINAL_REPORT.md` → `project_files/FONT_SYSTEM_FINAL_REPORT.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` → `project_files/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `TEST_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` → `project_files/TEST_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md`

### 3. Moved Component-Specific Files to `tests/<component>/update_md/`
Component-specific documentation was moved to appropriate test documentation directories:

- `main_app_window.md` → `tests/ui_components/update_md/main_app_window.md`
- `intergrate_preferences.md` → `tests/pref/update_md/intergrate_preferences.md`

### 4. Root Directory Clean-up
Only `README_NEW.md` remains in the root directory, which is appropriate as the main project documentation.

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Clear Separation:** Project-level documentation is separated from component-specific documentation
2. **Rule Compliance:** Follows rules.md guidelines for file organization
3. **Maintainability:** Easier to find relevant documentation in logical locations
4. **Consistency:** Aligns with existing test documentation structure
