# Phase 3: Drag & Drop Integration

**Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Component**: Enhanced Explorer Panel  
**Status**: Implementation Complete

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Phase 3 (Drag & Drop Integration) for the Enhanced Explorer Panel. This phase adds intuitive drag and drop functionality, allowing users to efficiently manage files and directories within the application and between the application and external sources.

## Implementation Components

The drag and drop implementation includes the following components:

1. **Drag & Drop Service**
   - Located in `services/drag_drop_service.py`
   - Handles drag start, drag execution, and drop processing
   - Integrates with FileOperationsService for actual file operations

2. **Enhanced File View Updates**
   - Added drag and drop event handlers to `widgets/enhanced_file_view.py`
   - Implemented mouse press/move detection for initiating drags
   - Added drop target handling with directory highlighting

3. **Service Integration**
   - Connected DragDropService with FileOperationsService
   - Implemented proper MIME data handling for files and directories

## Key Features

The implementation provides the following drag and drop capabilities:

1. **Internal Drag & Drop**
   - Move files and directories within the application
   - Copy files and directories with modifier keys (Ctrl)
   - Visual feedback during drag operations

2. **External Drag & Drop**
   - Drag files from the application to external applications
   - Accept files dropped from external applications
   - Proper handling of file:// URLs and text data

3. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Visual feedback for drop targets
   - Automatic directory highlighting during drag over
   - Support for standard system drag and drop conventions

## Implementation Details

### DragDropService

The `DragDropService` class provides the core functionality:

- `start_drag()`: Initiates a drag operation with proper MIME data
- `process_drop()`: Handles dropped data and performs appropriate file operations
- Integrates with FileOperationsService for actual file operations

### Event Handling

The implementation handles several key Qt events:

- `mousePressEvent`: Captures the potential start of drag operations
- `mouseMoveEvent`: Detects drag motion and initiates drag if threshold exceeded
- `dragEnterEvent`: Validates incoming drag data
- `dragMoveEvent`: Provides visual feedback for drop targets
- `dropEvent`: Processes the dropped data

### Path Management

The implementation includes robust path handling:

- Extracts file paths from QUrls in drop data
- Determines appropriate target directories for drops
- Handles drops on files by using their parent directory
- Supports drops in empty space by using current directory

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with the following scenarios:

- Dragging files within the application
- Dragging files from the application to external applications
- Dropping files from external applications
- Various file types and directory structures
- Edge cases such as drops in empty space

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. **Custom Drag Visuals**
   - Add preview thumbnails for dragged items
   - Implement drag count badge for multiple selections

2. **Advanced Drop Operations**
   - Implement custom drop menus (copy/move/link options)
   - Add special handling for specific file types

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize for large file sets
   - Implement background processing for large operations

## Conclusion

The Phase 3 implementation successfully adds comprehensive drag and drop functionality to the Enhanced Explorer Panel, significantly improving the user experience for file management tasks. The implementation follows Qt best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing file operations infrastructure.
